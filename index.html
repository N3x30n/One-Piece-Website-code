    <h1>Intro to One Piece</h1>
    <p>One piece is an anime and manga series from japan. The manga started in 1997, and the anime started in 1999. Author Eiichiro Oda started One piece because of his inspiration from a childhood TV show called ‘Vicky the Viking’. Currently One Piece has 1093 chapters and the anime has 1077 episodes and is still currently airing and being produced. One piece has its own type of power scaling when it comes to its characters. There are 3 forms of ‘combat’ in a sense. The first and main one are things called Devil Fruits. These are basically fruits that give the user special powers that they can manipulate in combat. For example the Mera Mera No Mi also known as the Flame fruit turns the users body into fire they can manipulate and use to their advantage such as shooting flaming bullets from their fingers or turning the soles of their feet into fire to propel themselves into the air. Another devil fruit that is used in the series is the Ito Ito No Mi also known as the String fruit. This allows the user to generate and manipulate wafer-like, razor-sharp strings that can attach to almost any surface.
